# RAML Server [![](https://badge.fury.io/js/raml-server.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/raml-server)
Get a full fake REST API with **zero coding** by writing a [RAML](http://raml.org/) spec.

**Why building a new RAML based server?** Cause this one works with [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), so no much code to do (maintain).

This is an open source project, so issues, PRs and suggestions are wellcome.

### Install

RAML Server is tested under node v0.12. If you don't have node installed yet, doing it via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is recommended.

If you have node installed, run

```
$ npm install -g raml-1-server
```

### Usage

Start a server based on the ```exampleApi.raml``` file

```
$ raml-1-server exampleApi.raml
```

And hit ```localhost:3000/songs```. Also, later POSTs to /songs on the server will be saved!

### How it works?

This is done by generating responses' data reading the JSON schemas with the [RAML Mocker](https://github.com/RePoChO/raml-mocker), and run with [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

### Next release fixes

* Support _imports_ in RAML.
* Support nested resources (today it only routes the JSON schema of the top level resources, like /songs).
* RAML 1.0.
* Start a server based on the ```api.raml``` file that is on the current directory if no argument is provided.
